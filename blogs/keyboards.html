      <h3>Keyboards, time to make the switch</h3>
      <h4>My Knowledge</h4>
      <p>I'll start off by saying I'm not even close to an authority on keyboards, nor
      have I even experienced more than the average person might have. But then again, you
      probably figured that out just by reading the terrible pun in the title. That being
      said, if you're at all interested in hearing about my opinions on some that I do have
      experience with, then you're in the right place. I'll separate this into sections that
      I hope make sense. For the reader: I will be using MK to mean mechanical keyboard.</p>
      <h4>Mechanical</h4>
      <p>I got into the world of MKs just about one year ago. I was, like
      many other, first drawn to clickiness and RGB backlighting. I thought MKs were simply
      meant to be loud and cool. So, for this first year, I have used a
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Redragon-K552-RGB-Mechanical-Keyboard-Construction/dp/B019O9BLVY/ref=psdc_402051011_t1_B016MAK38U">Redragon Kumara</a>
      with Outemo Blue Switches. Throughout this time, I have learned a lot more and hope
      to share that here.</p>
      <h5>Switches</h5>
      <p>The most famous are Cherry MX switches, I've also used Outemo through my
      first keyboard, and heard of Gateron. I won't describe and explain all the parts
      of switches and terminology such as actuation points, actuation force, key travel,
      etc. but I recommend you look <a href="https://www.dygma.com/mechanical-switches/the-ultimate-guide-to-mechanical-keyboard-switches-for-2019/">here</a>
      if you do want that in-depth guide. I'll summarize the color switches that I believe
      are most prevalent throughout brands. The reds, a linear, quiet switch. The blues, a
      clicky, loud switch. The browns, a tactile, quiet switch. </p>
      <h5>Keycaps</h5>
      <p>At first, I wasn't even aware of this world. I thought MKs all came in a box,
      assembled and ready to go. I joined the MK <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">subreddit</a>
      and was introduced to a whole new way of thinking. Not only is ordering kits and
      assembling them yourself the more common method of purchasing a new keyboard,
      but there is an entire market of artisanal keycaps, particularly for escape keys. </p>
      <h5>Low-Profile?</h5>
      <p>As an avid watcher of both MKBHD and Unbox Therapy, I found myself interested in
      both keyboards created by <a href="https://www.keychron.com/">Keychron</a>. The
      first, a very low-profile keyboard with almost apple-esque chiclet style keycaps, as well </p>
      <h4>Apple</h4>
      <p>Apple has had some struggles in the keyboard department recently. I only include this
      because I have only ever used MacBook Pros as my personal computer. They were doing perfectly
      fine, until their decision to innovate the famed "butterfly" switches
      which replaced the normal "scissor" switches. I was fortunate enough to switch directly
      from a 2015 13-inch to a 2019 16-inch, but I did type on the butterfly switches on occasion.
      Considering I never owned them, I never ran into issues long-term with them, but even the
      typing experience was just not as responsive, and it was a lot clicker than most. Here's to
      Apple getting rid of those keyboard forever.</p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>Some form of explanation here.</p>
