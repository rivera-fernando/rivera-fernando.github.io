      <h3>Phones, a refreshing topic</h3>
      <h4>The Five Pillars</h4>
      <p>Here I'll borrow from MKBHDs five pillars of a good phone and give my own opinions
      and twist to each category.</p>
      <h5>Build Quality</h5>
      <p>I'll start off by saying I miss metal backed phones. Then I'll add on to that
      the fact that I also do appreciate wireless charging in certain situations, and
      especially love reverse wireless charging. These aren't fully functional with metal
      backs. Taking a look at today's phones, they (the high-end ones at
      least)  all seem to be "glass sandwiches" which just means they have a glass front and
      back, with a metal framework around it. They look incredible, and scratch less
      easily than metal, but they also crack, and those repairs aren't easy. Now, I don't
      see a clear winner here, but if I had to pick, weighing in my lack of history in
      dropping phones as well as my almost-constant case usage, I'd pick the current
      landscape of iPhones and Galaxy phones.</p>
      <h5>Display</h5>
      <p>Displays in phones have changed a lot in the past few years. Largely however,
      most of the changes at the beginning of this evolution were regarding the elimination
      of bezels. This took many different forms, but the most widely used ones were Apple's
      conspicuous notch, hole-punch displays, and completely bezel-less phones with pop-up
      cameras. My personal favorite has been hole-punch displays, but I see the argument
      for Apple's notch and the hardware that it houses for FaceID. Pop-up or swivel cameras,
      while innovative and interesting in concept, just provide another moving part that
      could potentially break, and no one wants that. In the last year or so, display changes
      have been focused around not the shape or size, but the clarity and, specifically, the
      refresh rate. I remember hearing about it first with the OnePlus 7's 90Hz display, and
      then other phones began to follow suit quickly. Now, I use a Galaxy S20 Ultra with a 120Hz
      display and I love it.</p>
      <h5>Cameras</h5>
      <p>Bumps and lenses</p>
      <h5>Battery Life</h5>
      <p>This one seems simple, just look at the mAh in the phone's specs and bigger means
      better right? Honestly, for the most part that'll probably work, but mileage will
      vary greatly depending on screen size, brightness, refresh rate, and the type of
      usage you will be regularly taking part in. If there are any takeaways though, I personally
      don't mind a bigger phone if it means I can last a whole day with all of the things I
      mentioned above maxed out. What can I say, I love a good looking display!</p>
      <h5>Performance</h5>
      <p>Snapdragons and A#</p>
      <h4>Other Considerations</h4>
      <h5>Flagship Status</h5>
      <p>Flagship killer -> flagship. Samsung, Apple, Google</p>
      <h5>Moving Forward</h5>
      <p>Foldables, dual screens.</p>
      <h5>Perfect Phone</h5>
      <p>Samsung display (if 120 refresh rate plus WQHD+), OnePlus OxygenOS, 5000mAh battery,
      build of iPhone5, newest snapdragon, all the GB of RAM, expandable storage, cameras of
      Samsung S20 Ultra but Pixel camera software and post processing, </p>
